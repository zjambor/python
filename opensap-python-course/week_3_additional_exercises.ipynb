That means all values from the old tuple have to be picked and placed into a new tuple with the additional values. To make live easier in the future, the tuples should next be changed into a dictionary. Iterate over the dictionary `new_league`. For each team create a new dictionary `team_info`. For the keys use descriptive names like `\"points\"` or `\"goal difference\"`. Assign the value from the tuples as value to these keys. Assign the dictionary `team_info` as the value to the team in the dictionary of the teams. Finally, loop over the dictionary and display the team information."
