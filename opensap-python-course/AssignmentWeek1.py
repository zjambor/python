"""
Triangles can be classified based on their angles.

    A right triangle has one angle of 90째
    A obtuse triangle has one angle of more than 90째
    A triangle is acute if all three angles are less than 90째

Write a program that asks the user for the values of three angles in degrees. 
First check if the entered values are valid. The values are only valid if they are >0 and if their sum is 180째. 
If the entered values are valid, classify the triangle as right, acute or obtuse.
